            <h3>Who I Am</h3>
            <p>I'm someone who believes that leadership isn't just about achieving personal success—it's about creating opportunities for others to discover their potential. Whether it's organizing a robotics tournament, captaining a cricket team, or sharing a meal I've cooked, I find fulfillment in bringing people together and helping them grow.</p>
            <p>I'm a problem-solver who isn't afraid to get creative when resources are limited. When faced with challenges like low enrollment or budget constraints, I find innovative solutions—like using pool noodles and scrap cardboard instead of expensive materials, or involving other students in collaborative ways.</p>
            <p>I value the process of learning and growth, both for myself and others. I believe in the power of delegation, collaboration, and creating spaces where everyone can contribute their unique strengths.</p>
            
            <h3>My Aspirations</h3>
            <p>I aspire to attend the Jerome Fisher M&T program, where I can fuse engineering and ingenuity to inspire others. I want to continue championing the mindset that leadership is about providing platforms for others to find their potential.</p>
            <p>My goal is to combine my passion for engineering with my ability to lead and inspire, creating solutions and opportunities that extend beyond myself. I'm excited about the possibility of merging technology, business, and human connection to make a meaningful impact.</p>
            <p>Long after the robots power down or the game ends, I want the communities I've helped build and the platforms I've created to continue thriving—creating a lasting legacy of empowerment and growth.</p>
