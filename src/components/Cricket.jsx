            <h3>Captaincy at Sir Garfield Sobers International Tournament</h3>
            <p>As captain of an international team at the Sir Garfield Sobers International Cricket Tournament in Barbados, I faced one of my biggest challenges: leading a group of complete strangers to victory. Team members came from across the globe - Jayden from Georgetown, Guyana; Aarav from Denver; Sachin from New York.</p>
            <p>When an underdog team upset us in our third game, I realized that leadership isn't about carrying the burden alone. I learned to delegate and empower each team member. Shiloh, our vocal wicket-keeper, kept players accountable; Ajay, the vice-captain, refined our batting strategy; Dave, a senior player, led our spin bowlers.</p>
            <p>Through team dinners and open communication, we transformed from a fragmented group into a cohesive unit. Each game produced an unlikely hero, and every moment became a learning opportunity. We went on to win the finals, and I discovered that true success comes from lifting each other up and bearing the load together.</p>
            <p>This experience taught me that great leadership isn't about individual heroics—it's about creating an environment where everyone can contribute their best and reach their full potential.</p>
