                    <h3>Captaincy at Sir Garfield Sobers International Tournament</h3>
                    <p>As captain of an international team at the Sir Garfield Sobers International Cricket Tournament in Barbados, I faced one of my biggest challenges: leading a group of complete strangers to victory. Team members came from across the globe - Jayden from Georgetown, Guyana; Aarav from Denver; Sachin from New York.</p>
                    <p>When an underdog team upset us in our third game, I realized that leadership isn't about carrying the burden alone. I learned to delegate and empower each team member. Shiloh, our vocal wicket-keeper, kept players accountable; Ajay, the vice-captain, refined our batting strategy; Dave, a senior player, led our spin bowlers.</p>
                    <p>Through team dinners and open communication, we transformed from a fragmented group into a cohesive unit. Each game produced an unlikely hero, and every moment became a learning opportunity. We went on to win the finals, and I discovered that true success comes from lifting each other up and bearing the load together.</p>
                    <p>This experience taught me that great leadership isn't about individual heroics—it's about creating an environment where everyone can contribute their best and reach their full potential.</p>

                        <p>I find joy in transforming simple ingredients into something special. Cooking is my way of blessing the mundane and turning what sustains us into what nourishes us. I especially love preparing dishes like paneer tikka biryani, following precise sequences of ingredients—each step matters, from the first paneer tikka to the final saffron and biryani masala.</p>
                        <p>My passion for cooking connects me to my heritage, bringing together flavors from different cultures. I've spent hours hand-picking herbs and preparing dishes to share with classmates and teachers, turning meals into expressions of love, luxury, and cultural heritage.</p>

                        <p>I'm passionate about robotics and engineering, particularly when I can inspire others through hands-on experiences. I love the creative problem-solving that comes with building robots and organizing events that bring people together around technology.</p>
                        <p>There's something magical about seeing students explore robotics for the first time—watching their eyes light up as they discover that engineering goes beyond metal parts and computer cores. It's about providing a platform for others to find their potential.</p>

                    <h3>Who I Am</h3>
                    <p>I'm someone who believes that leadership isn't just about achieving personal success—it's about creating opportunities for others to discover their potential. Whether it's organizing a robotics tournament, captaining a cricket team, or sharing a meal I've cooked, I find fulfillment in bringing people together and helping them grow.</p>
                    <p>I'm a problem-solver who isn't afraid to get creative when resources are limited. When faced with challenges like low enrollment or budget constraints, I find innovative solutions—like using pool noodles and scrap cardboard instead of expensive materials, or involving other students in collaborative ways.</p>
                    <p>I value the process of learning and growth, both for myself and others. I believe in the power of delegation, collaboration, and creating spaces where everyone can contribute their unique strengths.</p>
                    
                    <h3>My Aspirations</h3>
                    <p>I aspire to attend the Jerome Fisher M&T program, where I can fuse engineering and ingenuity to inspire others. I want to continue championing the mindset that leadership is about providing platforms for others to find their potential.</p>
                    <p>My goal is to combine my passion for engineering with my ability to lead and inspire, creating solutions and opportunities that extend beyond myself. I'm excited about the possibility of merging technology, business, and human connection to make a meaningful impact.</p>
                    <p>Long after the robots power down or the game ends, I want the communities I've helped build and the platforms I've created to continue thriving—creating a lasting legacy of empowerment and growth.</p>
