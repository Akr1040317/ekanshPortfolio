                        <h3>The Thunder Dome</h3>
                        <p>I arrived at the Thunder Dome. Battle cries echoed through ironclad gates. Here, metallic beasts fought and died. At least, that's what the kids felt.</p>
                        <p>The "Thunder Dome" was actually the Markham Woods Middle School cafeteria, the "metallic beasts" were 4-wheeled robots inside 3D-printed dinosaur-inspired bodies, and the "battle cries" were wide-eyed students' excited cheers. To them, the difference was moot.</p>
                        <p>Walking into Robotics class in room 4205A eight months earlier, I noticed two glaring issues: low enrollment and lacking funds. So I masterminded Markham Mechatronic Madness, a fundraising event where local students could get hands-on experience in robot-racing tournaments and obstacle courses. Instead of buying trophies, I involved AutoCAD students by holding trophy-design contests. When we overshot our budget, we fashioned racetracks out of old pool noodles, foam tiles, and scrap cardboard and negotiated with Papa John's and Publix for free catering. Along the way, I documented everything in a 21-page step-by-step guide so future students could cement the event as tradition.</p>
                        <p>Even today, I tirelessly promote the event and return to the "Thunder Dome" every March as host, speaking to larger crowds and admiring more inventive robots. Hearing students laugh as they explore robotics beyond metal parts and computer cores for the first time, I realize leadership isn't just raising funds or increasing enrollment, but providing a platform for others to find their potential.</p>
                        <p>At the Jerome Fisher M&T program, I'll champion that mindset, fusing engineering and ingenuity to inspire others, long after the robots power down.</p>

                        <h3>The Art of Cooking</h3>
                        <p>First, paneer tikka. Then rice. Followed by ghee, cilantro, mint, extra fried onions, saffron, and biryani masala, in that order.</p>
                        <p>Like Spongebob dutifully assembling a "Crying Johnny," I mutter the sacred sequence of ingredients. Cooking, I feel, is a way to bless the mundane, a way to transform what sustains us into what nourishes us.</p>
                        <p>As I seal the lid with dough, I'm taken back to the gullies of India, where Persian cuisine fused with local tastes to conjure this dish. Aromas of clove and cardamom baptize the kitchen, every spice a testament to the cultural collisions that flavor our lives: cinnamon from Sri Lanka's central highlands, red chilies from Kashmir's snow-tipped mountains, star anise from Vietnam's lush forests.</p>
                        <p>Tomorrow, I'll share this paneer tikka biryani with my classmates and teachers. Crowned with fluffy basmati rice, golden ghee, and hand-picked herbs (seriously, this single step took 2 hours), they won't just be eating food; they'll indulge in love, luxury, and heritage in a bowl.</p>

                    <h3>Captaincy at Sir Garfield Sobers International Tournament</h3>
                    <p>"Um, alright guys. Let's just, uh, get started with the meeting."</p>
                    <p>Even if my camera was off, I'm sure they would've seen that I wasn't feeling ready. After all, this was my first time captaining a team, that too at the Sir Garfield Sobers International Cricket Tournament in Barbados. Worse, we were all strangers. Jayden came from Georgetown, Guyana, Aarav from Denver, Sachin from New York.</p>
                    <p>Initially, I thought victory rested on me. But when an underdog upset us in the third game, I knew something had to change. As a team, we were fragmented and frustrated.</p>
                    <p>That night, I organized a team dinner. Instead of a pep talk, I simply asked each player to share one way we could improve. Soon, the sound of crickets and ceiling fans gave way to animated discourse and collective learning. Batting tips from playing in the Caribbean, fast-bowling strategies crafted on Texas' bouncy cricket pitches, and observations flew across the table.</p>
                    <p>As the tournament continued, I started delegating responsibilities. Shiloh, a vocal wicket-keeper, kept players accountable; Ajay, the vice-captain, refined our batting game plan; Dave, a senior player, led the spin bowlers.</p>
                    <p>Soon, each game produced an unlikely hero, and every team dinner proved a goldmine of knowledge. As we danced all the way from the ground after winning the finals, I saw the cohesive community we had built. I learned that success didn't demand shouldering the weight alone, but bearing the load together and lifting each other up in the process.</p>
